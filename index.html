						<h2>Who is PayPal?</h2>
						
						<p>
							You have heard of PayPal, right? PayPal is one of the biggest payment 
							players in the world. By using their service, you can transfer money to 
							your friends or pay for things you bought online. Their goal is to give 
							you the feeling of security when transferring money to a stranger from 
							some random online shop. Online shops that provide the possibility to pay 
							with PayPal seem more trustworthy - after all, it is a big company with 
							millions of users that claims to ensure safe transactions. And if many 
							people use it, then it must be good, right? 
						</p>

						<div class="left-container"> 
							<p>
								Using PayPal is free for us as users, so how come it makes billions as a 
								company? Well, as a general rule, you can remember: If you don’t pay with 
								money for a service, then you most likely pay with your data. And that’s 
								also the case with PayPal. Yes, PayPal needs some information from you to 
								process a payment. But what seems suspicious is that PayPal collects much 
								more information than what is essential to process a simple online payment. 
								Storing that much data on servers costs money. Since they have over 400 
								million users, this would be extremely expensive. So, there must be a catch!

								Sometimes, your choices are not really yours, and you don't always make a 
								decision on your own. Companies like PayPal use tricks to influence you: <br />
								Imagine that in your school cafeteria, apples and water could be on the 
								display, while chips and coke could be placed under the counter. Everyone 
								could still make the choice for themselves, but they would be looking at healthy 
								food while waiting, and might even not be fully aware of the other options. It 
								would just be easier to get something that is easily reachable and visible - 
								thus nudging people to buy healthy food instead of the unhealthy one. (Although 
								usually, chips and coke are on display and not the healthy stuff, watch out!) 
							</p>
							<p>
								Although you are ultimately free to decide, what you agreed to is most probably 
								the result of companies’ efforts and psychological tricks.

								Whenever you make an online payment, download an app or use any kind of service,

								First of all, the Terms & Conditions are 99% of the time longer than your history 
								homework of an entire month. PayPal’s Terms & Conditions has far more words than 
								the Terms & Conditions of other companies that offer similar services. To read PayPal's 
								Terms & Conditions, the average reader would need 1.5 hours. That`s a lot of time for 
								reading a boring document that`s written with many long sentences. Especially when the 
								whole point of using services like PayPal is to make quick transactions.

								Luckily, we have the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is a long 
								document that holds laws and rules around data privacy that all businesses 
								collecting and processing personal data in the European Union (EU) have to follow. 
								This document sets the bar very high, and many businesses that collect data had to

							</p>
						</div>

					<section style="font-size: 20px;">
						<p>
							Here is one article from the GDPR that sets rules about how personal data should be processed: 
						</p>
						<br />
						<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
							GDPR Article 5 <br />
							<br />
							„1. Personal data shall be: <br />
							<br />
							Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the 
							purpose for which they are processed (data minimization).“
						</blockquote>
						<br />
						<p>
							Here comes the problem: It is not defined what ‘adequate, relevant and limited’ data is, 
							so companies can - and, disclaimer, they do - interpret it any way they want to. Therefore, 
							PayPal may collect any data as long as they can justify it with their business interests. 
							PayPal’s business interests are not really obvious to the user and are described vaguely, 
							so PayPal can justify collecting and processing basically anything. And this is what they do.

								Let’s take this example to another level: Imagine the effect that such a decision would 
								have when someone applies for a job. Just because the applicant had the same hairstyle 
								or the same coat as a candidate that was not so good at the interview doesn’t tell if

							Luckily, it’s not allowed to make decisions based on someone’s race, gender, sexual

							<a style="font-weight: 600;" href="#/10/1">algorithms</a> that make decisions for humans? Of course it does, but algorithms are better

							characteristics that <a style="font-weight: 600;" href="#/10">correlate</a> with the protected class. For example, zip code could

								Any variable that correlates with a protected variable can be used to 
								make predictions. Even if the algorithm has no information about race, 
								gender or religion, it uses proxies that say something about a protected 
								group of people. This leads to treating people the same as people who have

								Yes, we are. You probably also know someone in your friend group or family who

							actually correct, it just assumes it because it seems to be best fit based on that one 
							piece of information. You are placed in a box with people that seem similar to you. The 
							decisions of your friends and everyone else on the planet to share personal information 
							have an effect on all the people who don’t share personal information. When sharing personal 
							information online, we don’t only make a decision for ourselves, but also for all the people 
							who actually don’t want to share their personal information. If enough people provide enough 
							data, then predictions can be made about people who haven’t shared their own data. This is 
							called “data aggregation”.

						<h2>To sum it all up:</h2>
						<p>
							The aim of our work is to help you make informed decisions. 
							PayPal is just a single example of how the digital world works. 
							Similar issues can be found in numerous other platforms or businesses, 
							especially given the digitalisation of nearly everything. 
						</p>

						<h2>To sum it all up:</h2>
						<p>
							The world is quickly moving towards a data-governed status quo. We, 
							therefore, need deeper insights into what that means and how we can protect 
							ourselves from data misuse. We should be able to move in sync with this new 
							digital age, instead of constantly being fearful of its side effects. The only 
							remedy to that is knowledge and information. And that is what we hope we have 
							achieved through our website.

								A correlation describes the connection between two things. <br />
								Many people buy ice cream on 
								hot summer days. Because the sun is so intense, many people also get a sunburn. There is 
								a correlation between the amount of sunburned people and the amount of ice cream that is 
								eaten. If more people are eating ice cream, more people will also be sunburned. However, 
								the correlation between two things says nothing about the cause. The amount of ice cream 
								that is eating does not cause people to get a sunburn, or the other way around. In this 
								case, the cause for the amount of sunburned people and the amount of ice cream eaten is  
								a third variable, namely the hot summer weather.

						<h2>Algorithms</h2>
						<p>An algorithm is a specific set of rules that are applied step-by-step to get a solution to a 
							problem. A simple example is a recipe for baking a cake. You have a step-by-step 
							instruction about what you have to do to have a delicious cake in the end. (Just 
							make sure next time you’re sharing a recipe with someone, not to say “I have an amazing 
							cheesecake algorithm for you”, that’s probably going to confuse your fellow baker!)

						<h2>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
							<p>AI systems hold such algorithms to solve very complex systems, such as recognizing objects 
								on images. Because such algorithms are too hard to understand for humans, AI systems find 
								the solutions and algorithms themselves. Imagine you have an image of a dog and want to 
								determine which breed it is. Some smart person has created an AI for that by taking 
								hundreds of thousands of dog images with the breed name and showing it to the AI. The 
								AI learns which features are unique to a labrador, a pug or a dalmatian. You can then take 
								any dog image you want, and the AI will tell you which breed it is. What makes AI systems 
								‘intelligent’ is that they are able to learn the algorithms by themselves and they can 
								then determine the breed very well from dog images that the AI has never seen before.

						<h2>Nudging</h2>
						<p>
							Do you think that your choices online are really yours? <br >
							That you are the one that has made the decision to share your data? 
						</p>
						<p>
							Nudging strategies use cognitive shortcuts in decision making to make 
							irrational behavior more explainable and even predictable.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although you are ultimately free to decide, what you agreed to is most 
							probably the result of companies’ efforts and psychological tricks. People’s 
							behavior is predictable! <br >
							This fact can be used to get desired outcomes or manipulate users. The specific 
							placement of certain buttons can <a style="font-weight: 600; color: #253b80;">nudge</a> 
							you into a certain direction. This makes you think that the choice was yours, while still 
							allowing the company to get their desired outcome.

						<div class="left-container">
							<p>Sometimes, a nudge can become a dark pattern if it’s designed to make you choose something 
								with bad consequences for you. 
							</p>
							<p>“To share” or “not to share”? That is the question! </p>	
							<p>
								Well, in this case, it’s barely a question, since you’re getting pushed to “share” 
								without even considering the alternative. That’s what dark patterns and nudging do.
